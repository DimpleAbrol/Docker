sudo usermod -a -G docker $USER  -- give permission to a user (current user $USER), -a (add), -G (group)
sudo reboot -- reboot system 
docker ps --- to see running container
docker pull mysql --- pull mysql image from docker hub
docker images --- to check images
docker run -d -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=test@123 mysql:latest  --- Run image to create container -d(demon) -e(environment) // -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=test@123 mysql requires pasword to run
docker ps --- to see the sunning container
